                        edition of the Symmetry Autumn of Code (SAOC). We invite motivated individuals who enjoy solving
                        problems with code to apply for the opportunity to earn money hacking on D projects! You <a

                    <p>
                        Those who participate will need mentors, so we're also looking for experienced D programmers to take on
                        the job. If you know the D programming language and enjoy sharing your knowledge with others, we invite
                        you to put your skills to use in guiding and advising the coders who will join us this autumn. We'll
                        even pay you for it! <a href="#mentors">Keep reading to see how you can participate</a>.

                        We're always looking for more project ideas from the D community. Each SAOC applicant will need to
                        submit a project proposal as part of the application. We ask anyone with an idea for a project that
                        would benefit the D ecosystem and that a solo programmer could reasonably expect to work on

                        Participants will be tasked with completing four monthly milestones for a project using the D
                        programming language. Each participant will be paid <b>USD $1000</b> upon successful completion
                        of each of the first three milestones (a total of <b>$3000</b> per participant). At the end of
                        the fourth milestone, the overall progress of each participant will be evaluated by the SAOC
                        committee, and at least one participant will be selected to receive a final payment of <b>USD
                        $1000</b>. That lucky coder will also be eligible for <b>a free pass to the next real-world
                        DConf</b>, including reimbursement of travel and hotel expenses.

                        coders currently enrolled in a school program. We are looking for creative, driven, and
                        goal-oriented individuals who are willing to contribute to the D programming language. Those
                        looking to participate in the Symmetry Autumn of Code 2023 should expect to propose an idea for
                        a new open-source project or to establish specific goals for improving an existing project,
                        finalize milestones for evaluation of progress on the project, and work with a mentor for four
                        months to ensure the milestones are met. Participants should expect to put in 20 hours of work
                        each week, keep their mentor updated on their progress, provide status updates in the D forums,
                        and work with their mentor to submit monthly progress reports for review by the
                        SAOC judges.

                        To apply, please send a project proposal and résumé to <a
                        href="mailto:social@dlang.org">social@dlang.org</a>. Make sure the subject line reads “SAOC

                        you sell us on your project. The résumé is where you show us why you're the person to get it done.
                        <strong>Markdown is the preferred format. Please do not send files in a word processor format (DOCX,
                        ODT, etc.) or PDF</strong>.

                            In 800 words or less, describe the project to which you're willing to devote four months of
                            work. Why did you select it? What specific goals do you want to achieve? Will it be completed in
                            four months of effort at 20 hrs/week, or will more work be required beyond the event? How will
                            it benefit the D ecosystem and/or community?

                        <p>
                            Your project should require enough effort to keep you occupied throughout the event while also
                            being beneficial to the D community. You can find a list of project ideas in <a

                            dlang/project-ideas repository</a>. Those tagged with the <code>SAOC</code> label were suggested
                            specifically for SAOC, but any project may be suitable as long as it meets the aforementioned
                            criteria.

                            It is not an absolute requirement that applicants find a mentor before applying, but doing
                            so will have a positive impact on the evaluation of the application. As such, applicants are
                            encouraged to make an effort to find potential mentors before the application is submitted.
                            Once an applicant decides upon a project, a good first step toward finding a mentor would be
                            a post in <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D.announce forum</a>.

                            Briefly explain who you are and why you should be selected. Describe your experience working
                            with the D programming language or the language you're most comfortable working with. Tell us
                            about your life as a programmer: programming languages you've learned, projects you've worked
                            on, and programming-related topics you've studied. We recommend including a link to your GitHub
                            profile if you have any existing work there that you'd like us to see.

                            Note that you aren't applying for a job! We will not take into consideration your general
                            education or work history. We only want to get an idea of your level of programming experience.
                            It will also help us if you let us know what your course workload or your work schedule will be

                        We are looking for patient and experienced D programmers who are willing to provide support and
                        guidance to the coders who pursue their projects during the four months of SAOC. Mentors are
                        volunteers who the participants can look to for advice on the D programming language and how to
                        approach solving the problems they encounter as they carry out their work. Participants and mentors
                        will work together to establish the project milestones that will be used to evaluate performance.
                        Mentors will be expected to keep abreast of their coder's progress and to encourage their coder in
                        achieving each milestone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of SAOC 2023, each mentor whose student successfully completes the event will receive
                        a one-time payment of <b>$500</b>. Mentors of unsuccessful projects may also be eligible for the
                        same payment at the SAOC committee's discretion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are interested in becoming a mentor, please submit an email to social@dlang.org and let
                        us know which project, or what kinds of projects, you would be willing to mentor, as well as the
                        number of hours per week you can make yourself available to your coder during the event. The
                        event organizers may ask for more information, such as examples of your level of experience with
                        D, before deciding to accept your offer. Also, please pay attention to <a
                        href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D.announce forum</a> and be on the lookout for
                        SAOC applicants in need of a mentor.

                    <p>
                        Please note that mentors are not allowed to simultaneously participate as coders. Choose to apply only for one role!

                    <p>
                        Community members are encouraged to submit ideas for potential projects. Project suggestions should
                        require at least four months of work (assuming a minimum of 20 hours per week) and should be
                        beneficial to the D community. Ideally, each project suggestion should outline specific goals that
                        participants and their mentors can use to measure progress. The project should also provide a
                        reasonable amount of challenge. For example, <i>improve Visual D</i> is not an acceptable
                        suggestion, but a list of specific features to add to Visual D is fine.
                    </p>

                        Develop your project ideas in <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/general">the D forums</a> and
                        submit them as individual issues to <a href="https://github.com/dlang/project-ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">the

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p class="pheader"><span>Can I use other languages alongside the D language in my project?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, but make sure that the focus is on the D language. We are more likely to select applicants that
                        prioritize it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>How do you select applicants?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        We like to see experience with the D language, but a good track record of finished projects in
                        any language is valuable. Preference will be given to graduate and postgraduate students. The
                        proposed project's perceived benefit to the D community is a big factor in the decision, and so
                        is the quality of the proposal. Applicants who are motivated to research their project and
                        provide a solid description of the project in the proposal are just the sort of programmers
                        we're looking for. Finding a mentor before applying is not a big factor, but can make the
                        difference if there are more proposals than available slots when all other things are equal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>Can I work with a partner or a team of people?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        No. Symmetry Autumn of Code is intended for solo work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>Can I earn course credit for participating in SAOC?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Please check with your school for their policy. If they determine you are eligible for course
                        credit, we can provide documentation for them upon a successful final evaluation of your SAOC
                        project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>Can the schedule be adjusted to adapt to my school or work schedule?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, no. We understand that our schedule will not work for everyone, and we are sorry if
                        it conflicts with yours. However, we welcome contributions to D outside of SAOC.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>How do I find a mentor?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        A post in <a href="https://forum.dlang.org/group/announce">the D.announce forum</a> is the best
                        place to start.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It isn't strictly necessary to find a mentor for a successful application. Doing so may increase
                        the chances an application will be successful and will certainly make the process easier for all
                        involved. If you are unable to find a mentor before submitting a successful application, we will
                        try to assist in matching you up with a mentor suitable for your project,  If you already know
                        someone who would be skilled in your proposed project area, don't hesitate to get in touch with
                        them to discuss your project and let us know about it in your application.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>Is SAOC considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        None of the above. SAOC is an activity that the participants perform as independent developers for
                        which they are paid a stipend. Applicants should check with their school or employer to ensure that
                        participation in SAOC does not violate any school or local government regulations or contractual
                        requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pheader"><span>What if my school/employer/local government does prohibit me from being paid as
                    a result of my participation? Can I participate without pay?</span></p>
                    <p>
                        Yes. We will accept applications from those who, for whatever reason, wish to participate without
                        pay. The application should make it clear that no payment is expected by the applicant. Those
                        participating without pay will still be evaluated upon completion of each milestone and provided
                        with feedback, but will not receive the stipend and will not be eligible for the free trip to DConf.

                    <p class="pheader"><span>What is Symmetry Investments?</strong></span></p>
                    <p>
                        Symmetry Investments is a global investment company with offices in Hong Kong, London, Singapore,
                        Jersey &amp; Cayman Islands. We have been in business since 2014 after successfully spinning off
                        from a major New York-based hedge fund.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Symmetry, we seek to engage in intelligent risk-taking to create value for our clients, partners,
                        and employees. We derive our edge from our capacity to generate Win-Wins&mdash;in the broadest
                        sense. Win-Win is our fundamental ethical and strategic principle. By generating Win-Wins, we can
                        create unique solutions that reconcile perspectives that are usually seen as incompatible or
                        opposites, and encompass the best that each side has to offer. We integrate fixed-income arbitrage
                        with global macro strategies in a novel way. We invent and develop technology that focuses on the
                        potential of human-machine integration. We build systems where machines do what they do best:
                        supporting people to do what people do best. We are creating a collaborative meritocracy, a culture
                        where individual contribution serves both personal and collective goals&mdash;and is rewarded
                        accordingly. We value both ownership thinking <em>and</em> cooperative team spirit, self-realization
                        <em>and</em> community.
                    </p>
